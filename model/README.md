Model for Open Advertising Protocol
=======================

The model represents the objects that are passed back and forth in the Open Advertising Protocol. It is imoortant
the model be rigorously defined so there's no confusion between the sender and receiver of an electronic 
document over the protocol. For example, the buyer and seller need to agree on the structure of an insertion order
so there's no mistake when sending an order.

The model is represented as XML Schemas stored in the [schemas directory](https://github.com/OpenAdvertisingProtocol/OpenAdvertisingProtocol/tree/master/model/schemas).
And there's corresponding docomentation in the [docs directory](https://github.com/OpenAdvertisingProtocol/OpenAdvertisingProtocol/tree/master/model/docs).

Note for discussion: Although the schemas are represented in XML Schemas, the Open Advertising Protocol is intented to support both XML 
and JSON.
